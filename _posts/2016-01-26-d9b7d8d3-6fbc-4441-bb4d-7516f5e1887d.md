I have been doing ultra-running for some time now and with a little experience come this personal collection of some dos and don'ts that I'd like people to know when they come across a runner like me. Most runners know these things well but if you're not a runner, please keep these things in mind:

-- If you're driving and you see a runner coming towards you, stay clear of the side of the road for him. Slow down. Runners run against traffic on the "wrong side of the road" so they can see incoming vehicles as they run. This is correct. Runners don't run along with the traffic.

-- If you're driving and you see a runner about to cross an intersection, stop for him. The brakes of your vehicle can handle sudden stops better than his feet. Wait for him to cross. If you stop too late on his path, a tired runner might not be able to stop or react quickly enough and he could get injured or he could give your car a nasty dent.

-- If you're walking and about to cross his path, stop or step away and let him pass. He will try to avoid you but it'll be easier for you than him to do this because your velocity is easier to manage. If you're standing on his way, step away. Collision with a runner may injure you and him.

-- Don't be shy to cheer a passing runner. It inspires him to continue running to the finish. Sometimes one brief word of encouragement sustains an exhausted runner to the finish. You'll be surprised that he can recall your deed long after the run is over. That's how powerful a cheer is to a runner. If you're a spectator in a race, do cheer for runners who are hurting and who are exhausted. Ease their pain and encourage them. Be vocal telling people that they are doing great -- even if all the evidence is to the contrary. Encourage everyone around you to cheer -- loudly! Runners really feed on the positivity of the spectators, and they really appreciate the fact that you are there. Cheer as much as you can. You never know---you just might give someone a lift when they need it most! However, don't say "You're almost there." You should only use those longed-for words if he is very near the finish line.

-- Giving him a high five or low five is fine. Attempting to hold, grab or give him a handshake is not. Do not block his way with your hand. Do not make him shift side to side to just avoid colliding with your hand. No he's not being a snob, he just doesn't want to inadvertently hurt you or himself, or maybe he just doesn't have to right now. A long line of hands for him to slap becomes a distraction and a safety hazard. Understand if he doesn't reach for your hand. A warm applause or cheer becomes more appropriate in this case.

-- Do not heckle or ridicule a runner. He could be running for reasons beyond your understanding. Runners run for fun, sport, strength, health, and personal achievement; some for competition, medals, prizes and rewards; some for very personal reasons like for emotional relief, coping with a loss, running for a sick friend, raising awareness for a cause. Whatever reason, hurtful words to a runner are like humps and hurdles that make his run even harder than necessary.

-- If you see him on a long empty stretch of road, say a greeting or ask if everything's alright. Make eye contact. Look runners in the eye. It snaps them out of their weariness. Render assistance to a runner in need.

-- You may offer a runner a bottle or cup of drink by calling his attention and raising it at his arms length towards his path. He'll glance at you and reach for it if he wants it. Lower it if he signals no, else he might collide with it and spill it. Hold it with all fingers scooped at the bottom brim, not around the mouth of the cup or bottle. Whether he takes it or not, he'll surely appreciate the kind gesture.

That's it for now. Let's all make our roads safe for runners. You might become one yourself. Hope this list helps. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6af19b64-4411-42ab-9afc-905781b7a480.jpg)
